There are 227 such rules for the monks, grouped according to the type of offense incurred for breaking the rule, with the exception of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aniyatas</i> (“the undetermined”) and the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhikaraṇasamathadhamma</i> (“the principles for resolving legal issues”), which are principles to be applied rather than rules in the strict sense. At present the Pātimokkha is only found embedded in the Suttavibhaṅga (“the Analysis of the Pātimokkha rules”), in which each rule is surrounded by explanatory material. Originally, however, the Pātimokkha probably existed as an independent text, known as the Pātimokkha-sutta. This can be seen from the fact that rules sometimes refer to other rules that immediately precede them, a connection that is now severed since the Suttavibhaṅga material separates the rules from each other.", "author_uid": "brahmali"}}, "content": {"pli-tv-bu-pm": {"pli-tv-bu-pm:0.1": {"pli": "Dvemātikāpāḷi ", "html": "<article id='pli-tv-bu-pm'><header><ul><li class='division'>{}</li></ul>"}, "pli-tv-bu-pm:0.2": {"pli": "Theravāda Bhikkhupātimokkha ", "eng": "The monks’ rules ", "html": "<h1 class='sutta-title'>{}</h1></header>"}, "pli-tv-bu-pm:1.0": {"pli": "Pubbakaraṇaṁ ", "eng": "Preliminaries ", "html": "<h4>{}</h4>"}, "pli-tv-bu-pm:1.1": {"pli": "Sammajjanī padīpo ca, udakaṁ āsanena ca; ", "eng": "Sweeping, and lamps, setting up of water and seats; ", "html": "<blockquote class='gatha'><p><span class='verse-line'>{}</span>"}, "pli-tv-bu-pm:1.2": {"pli": "Uposathassa etāni, “pubbakaraṇa”nti vuccati.
