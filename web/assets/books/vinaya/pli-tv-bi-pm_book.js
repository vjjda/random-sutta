There are 311 such rules for the nuns, grouped according to the type of offense incurred for breaking the rule, with the exception of the last group, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhikaraṇasamathadhamma</i> (“the principles for resolving legal issues”), which are principles to be applied rather than rules in the strict sense. At present the Pātimokkha is only found embedded in the Suttavibhaṅga (“the Analysis of the Pātimokkha rules”), in which each rule is surrounded by explanatory material. Originally, however, the Pātimokkha probably existed as an independent text, known as the Pātimokkha-sutta.
