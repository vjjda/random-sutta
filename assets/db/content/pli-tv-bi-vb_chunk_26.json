In Pali the male gender takes precedent if a group contains people of both sexes. For instance, the plural <i lang='pi' translate='no'>puttā</i>, “sons”, may mean “children” or “offsping”, depending on the context. In the same way, the plural <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhātāro</i>, “brothers”, can mean “siblings”. This way of understanding male-gender nouns is confirmed in the introduction to the Pali lexical work the Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Ettha hi mātā ca pitā ca pitaro, putto ca dhītā ca puttā, sassu ca sasuro ca sasurā, bhātā ca bhaginī ca bhātaroti bhinnaliṅgānampi ekaseso dassitoti</i>, “‘Mother and father are fathers; son and daughter are sons; mother-in-law and father-in-law are fathers-in-law; brother and sister are brothers;’ in this case the split gender is shown with only one gender remaining.” The Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā is available online at tipitaka.org.
