This is perhaps at least partly due to different doctrinal developments in the early Buddhist schools. Passages that in the Pali mention impermanence, suffering, and not-self, in parallels of the (Mūla)-Sarvāstivāda often include emptiness as well. This does not indicate any doctrinal contradiction, as emptiness is explained as meaning not-self. But it does suggest that the presentation in terms of emptiness was more popular in that group of schools. "},"mn121:1.2":{"pli":"ekaṃ samayaṃ bhagavā sāvatthiyaṃ viharati pubbārāme migāramātupāsāde.
