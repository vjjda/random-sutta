It is where three or four holes are made for inserting bolts.” Whenever the Canonical text lists the parts of a door and door frame, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aggaḷavaṭṭi</i> always has the same position, being grouped together with the parts for the locking mechanism, such as latches and bolts. Given the commentarial explanation, it is natural to think that it was a special post added to the door frame, or perhaps replacing the door frame, for the purpose of receiving bolts. “Bolt socket” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kapisīsaka</i>. Sp 4.260: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kapisīsakaṁ nāma dvārabāhaṁ vijjhitvā tattha pavesito aggaḷapāsako vuccati</i>, “The bolt-receiving socket which is inserted after piercing the door post is called a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kapisīsaka</i>.” “Bolt” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sūcika</i>.

The lifting would be done with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tāḷa</i>, a key-like device. “A door-pulling hole” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āviñchanachidda</i>.

In fact, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhaduka</i> is a curious word. On the face of it, it should mean “half a dyad”, but this hardly makes much sense in the context. A major problem with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhaduka</i> is that the reading is highly uncertain. The Buddha Jayantī Tipiṭaka of Sri Lanka gives the alternative <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhuraka</i>, SRT <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍharuka</i>, and the PTS edition <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍharūka</i>. The first of these is particularly interesting: it almost certainly means “half-chest-ed”. It could well be that this is the basis for the commentarial gloss. The actual commentarial reading (the lemma) may be due to a later “correction”, perhaps based on a change in the Canonical text. If we start with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhuraka</i> as the original form, it is relatively easy to explain the other two forms, which weighs in favor of this reading. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Aḍḍharuka</i> can be explained as an <i lang='pi' translate='no'>a/u</i> metathesis in <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhuraka</i>, which is all too common in oral tradition, especially with obscure words. Once the meaning was lost, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhaduka</i> may have formed as a kind of further corruption, either by accident or through intentional “correction”. We would then see the following pattern of corruption: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhuraka</i> > <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍharuka</i> > <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aḍḍhaduka</i>.

It is possible that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tantaka</i> is merely another term for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tanta</i> “a loom”. “Reed” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vema</i>.

I am unable to trace any exegetical information on this word; quite possibly the reading is corrupted. It may be that we should prefer the PTS reading of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vaṭa</i>, which can mean “string” or “tie”, according to SED. Since the warp seems to be covered by <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tantaka</i>, it does not seem unreasonable to suggest <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vaṭa</i> refers to the “weft”, that is, the cross-thread. “Shuttle” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>salāka</i>. The basic meaning of this word is “small stick”. In the Vinaya Piṭaka the word <i lang='pi' translate='no'>salāka</i> is used especially to designate the “voting tickets” that were sometimes used when making decisions in the monastic Sangha. The “shuttle” is a basic weaving equipment and its size would seem to fit well with the size of a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>salāka</i>. However, since there is no exegetical information on this word used in this context, this is no more than a hypothesis.
