However, I can find no confirmation of such a title, whereas the use of Jānaśruti as a patronymic by the descendants of Janaśruti is well attested.

Similarly, RV 10.121 speaks of the anonymous Creator who “existed alone”. "},"sn12.48:5.1":{"pli":"“Kiṃ pana, bho gotama, sabbaṃ puthuttan”ti?

Throughout the Rig Veda, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pṛthu</i> is the broad expanse of earth or waters, spread out by Indra (eg. RV 10.113.4) and burned over by Agni (RV 10.156.3). It has sexual connotations, too: an ample womb (RV 10.99.2) or a fat ass (RV 10.86.8; Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.2.5.16, 3.5.1.11). Thus while “oneness” suggests the Divinity that underlies all, “expansiveness” suggests the broad, pregnant world in which humans live. Thus the sacrificial cake should be spread expansively, but not too expansively, for that would make it human and therefore mortal (ŚB 1.2.2.9). In the Nāsadīya Sūkta instead of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pṛthu</i> we find <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tiraścīna</i> (“stretched across”; the two terms are synonymous at ŚB 6.3.3.19) describing the searching minds of the sage-poets: “Their cord was stretched across: Did something exist below it? Did something exist above?” (RV 10.129.5). Moreover, Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>puthu</i> stands for both Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pṛthu</i> (“broad, wide, expansive”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pṛthak</i> (“separate, individual”). Both senses apply here, and indeed, they are not separate even in the Rig Veda, for things that proceed separately (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pṛthak</i>, rays of the sun, rivers, cows) spread out (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pṛthu</i>) across the broad earth (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pṛthivī </i>).
