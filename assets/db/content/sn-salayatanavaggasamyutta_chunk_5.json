In the Rig Veda, the Bharatas were the clan ruled by King Sudās, who, blessed by Agni, the “fire of the Bharatas”, and allied with the Vāsiṣṭhas, overcame the armies of ten kings to dominate the Aryan coalition. Wijesekera has argued that <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhara</i> in this context originally meant the “booty” or “plunder” gained by raiding villages and towns (<em>Buddhist and Vedic Studies</em>, ch. 19). A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhārata</i> was a descendant of the tribe, and with their cultural ascendance became a term for all Vedists. Later it became generalized; the Jain Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra of the 12th century says that Bhāratakas include all Indians, whether Aryan or not (3.29). The Pali form <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bharataka</i> could here be simply a variation of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhārata</i> in the sense “Aryan”, but the suffix <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-ka</i> is often diminutive if not contemptuous (eg. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>samaṇaka</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>muṇḍaka</i>).
