The diminutive ending <i lang='pi' translate='no'>-ka</i> is perhaps meant to differentiate him from the smith Cunda. There are various Cundas whose connection is unclear. Mahācunda was one of the great disciples (<a href='index.html?q=mn118'>MN 118:</a>, <a href='index.html?q=an6.17'>AN 6.17</a>, <a href='index.html?q=mn8'>MN 8</a>), who later brought the Dhamma to the land of the Cetīs (<a href='index.html?q=an6.46'>AN 6.46</a>, <a href='index.html?q=an10.24'>AN 10.24</a>).

They also identify him with the “novice Cunda” who reported the deaths of Sāriputta (<a href='index.html?q=sn47.13#1.3'>SN 47.13:1.3</a>) and Mahāvīra (<a href='index.html?q=dn29#2.1'>DN 29:2.1</a>, <a href='index.html?q=mn104#3.1'>MN 104:3.1</a>), explaining that the title “novice” was a nickname that persisted from the time he ordained as a young novice. It is unclear whether the commentaries take the Cundaka of this passage to be the same person, but he is here performing a similar role as carer adjacent to the Buddha’s death. Later there appears a Cūḷacunda (<a href='index.html?q=tha-ap52#13.3'>Tha Ap 52:13.3</a>).

The better-known term, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbāna</i> (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nirvāṇa</i>), is from the root <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vā</i> (“to blow”), with the basic sense of going out through being deprived of air. The past participle form <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbuta</i> (Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nirvṛta</i>), from the root <i lang='pi' translate='no'>var</i> (“to check or restrain”), has the basic sense of freedom from obstacles and constrictions. Generally, the Pali treats <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbuta</i> as the past participle form of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbāna</i>, and for the most part the difference is purely verbal. Yet I believe the ambiguity is deliberate, as each captures a slightly different nuance of Nibbana. “Quenched” means both to go out like a flame and to be satisfied like a thirst. This positive feel appears in Sanskrit passages using <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nirvṛta</i>, such as Manusmṛti 1.54, where it describes the blissful absorption of all beings into the great divinity. By using “extinguishment” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbāna</i> and “quenched” for <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nibbuta</i> I hope to express this subtle distinction, or at least to alert the reader that it exists.

In Buddhist cosmology, this agrees with the fact that Sakka’s realm is the third of the heavens (after the earth gods and the four great kings).
