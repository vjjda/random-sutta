","html":"<p>{}","comm":"The use of ascetics for spies (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>cara</i>), which is still common today, is detailed by Kauṭilya in his Arthaśāstra. Those seeking a job can imitate bald (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>muṇḍa</i>) or matted-hair (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>jaṭila</i>) ascetics, pretending to live on a handful of greens but secretly eating what they like (as here). Other fake ascetics or spies disguised as merchants then acclaim them to build reputation (as Pasenadi here). When people seek prophecies, he foretells that those loyal to the king shall prosper and those who oppose him will suffer. The king’s minister then ensures that such prophecies come true (1.11.13, 1.13.15). Female mendicants are especially useful for manipulating the wives of officials (5.1.19, 5.1.50, 12.2.20), or officials regarding their wives (11.1.52). Ascetic spies are taught to manipulate loyalties with morality tales (1.14) and to fool enemy kings by faking magical powers (13.2; cp. Devadatta using magic to seduce Ajātasattu at <a href='index.html?q=pli-tv-kd17#2.1.1'>Kd 17:2.1.1</a>). They conduct assassinations by tricking targets into consuming poisons in the guise of a ritual (5.1.33) or love-potions (11.1.40), or he may first instigate rape, then accuse the rapist (11.1.48). Princes may also don the guise of such ascetics in order to escape a coup, while forest ascetics misdirect pursuers (7.17.50). Such spies earn a solid middle income comparable to soldiers, superintendents, teachers, or accountants (5.3.22–3). "},"sn3.11:7.2":{"pli":"Tehi paṭhamaṃ ociṇṇaṃ ahaṃ pacchā osāpayissāmi.
