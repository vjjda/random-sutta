But the direct inspiration for this discourse is probably the famous “Honey Lore”. Situated just after the revelation that the true Self is infinite consciousness, this passage identifies all aspects of being, including fire, as “honey”, since they partake of the immortal, the divine, and the “all” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.5). Likewise, after his teaching that the aggregates, including all forms of consciousness, are “not self” (<a href='index.html?q=sn22.59'>SN 22.59</a>), the Buddha inverts the message of the Honey Lore, pointing out that “all” we experience is on fire.
