I use the familiar Sanskrit forms, as the Pali has several dubious spellings and variants. Their texts and corresponding Vedas are respectively: Adhvaryu = Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (incl. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad; White Yajur Veda); Taittirīya = Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa (Black Yajur Veda); Chāndogya = Chāndogya Brāhmaṇa (Sāman Veda); Cāndrāyaṇa (omitted from MS edition) = Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa (Rig Veda; spelling established by Wijesekera; see below at <a href='index.html?q=dn13#16.2'>DN 13:16.2</a>); Bahvṛca = Bahvṛca Brāhmaṇa (Rig Veda; incorporated in Aitareya and Kauśītaki.) This is the only time the Pali canon mentions these schools, but in some cases we can identify them with brahmins in the canon. Examples include the murmuring Chāndogya brahmin (<a href='index.html?q=ud1.4'>Ud 1.4</a>); or the Buddha’s former teachers, who evidently hailed from the Addhariya tradition of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (<a href='index.html?q=mn26#15.1'>MN 26:15.1</a>ff.). | Jayatilleke notes that the Śatapatha describes its own adherents as Adhvaryu (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>addhariyā</i>), those priests of the Yajur Veda responsible for the physical acts at the ritual. Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 10.5.2.20 and Kauṣītaki Brāhmaṇa 6.5.6–10 list the Adhvaryu, Chandoga, and  Bahvṛca, thus including the same schools in the same order, except the Pali has split the Yajur and Rig followers into two.

According to the commentary, that was the first time they went for refuge, while this was the second time. This makes sense in terms of the progress of the teachings, for there they discuss what makes a brahmin, whereas here they ask the more subtle question how to achieve rebirth with Brahmā. The discussion, too, is on a more detailed level, with a more explicit criticism of the brahmins. Nonetheless, it is difficult to square the details of the narratives, for the opening of this sutta depicts Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja speaking about the Buddha by reputation rather than as devotees who have previously met him and gone for refuge.
