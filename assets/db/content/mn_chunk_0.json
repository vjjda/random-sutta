Alternatively, some modern interpreters (Bodhi, Ñāṇananda), relying on the commentarial background explanation, suggest that the problem was that they understood it all too well and were not happy that their beliefs were challenged. These explanations, however, do not take into account the centrality of “approval” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>nanda</i>)—it is literally the “root” that lends the discourse its title. Given that an arahant does not “approve” even Nibbāna, and that “approval” is the root of suffering, is it any wonder that the audience did not “approve” the teaching? It is not that they did not understand, nor that their understanding threatened their egos, but that they understood so well that they received the teaching with perfect equanimity. Elsewhere the Buddha urged that one should “neither approve (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>abhinandati</i>) nor dismiss” a teaching (<a href='index.html?q=an4.180#2.5'>AN 4.180:2.5</a> = <a href='index.html?q=dn16#4.8.4'>DN 16:4.8.4</a>, <a href='index.html?q=dn29#18.4'>DN 29:18.4</a>, <a href='index.html?q=mn112#3.1'>MN 112:3.1</a>). The normal response, where the audience approves a teaching with pleasure, is meant in a conventional sense, whereas this sutta shows how for an arahant all such responses are transcended.
