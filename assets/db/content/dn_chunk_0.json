The Buddha was a master of observation, and constantly drew from everyday experience to illustrate his teachings. The metaphor works on a surface level to illustrate how theorists are trapped.

Early Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>netrī</i> always retains the expected grammatical sense, a noun from the root “to lead”, i.e. a “leader” (Rig Veda 1.113.4, 4.56.2, 5.50.2, 7.76.6, 7.77.2). Compare the English concept of the psychopomp or ferryman who leads you to the afterlife. Here, the commentary explains, “It is a name for craving. For by it beings are bound in their heart and lead on to life after life, like an ox tethered by the throat.” This suggests the sense of “lead” as in “leash”, which fits the metaphor of “cutting off”.
