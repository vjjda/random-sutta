Strikingly, both the current sutta and SN 22.90 share a common narrative pattern. In both cases, an interlocuter (Saccaka or Channa, both known for their conceit) asks for teaching from a lesser teacher (Assaji or unnamed mendicants). Their reply omits suffering, but this fails. So they seek a better teacher (the Buddha, Ānanda) who not only includes suffering, but specially emphasizes it (<a href='index.html?q=mn35#21.2'>MN 35:21.2</a>, <a href='index.html?q=sn22.90#9.7'>SN 22.90:9.7</a>). This teaching is successful. This narrative journey mirrors that of Śvetaketu, who studied with others for twelve years before being shown true wisdom by his father Uddālaka. If we are on the right track, the point of the narrative is that it is essential to include suffering. This suggests that the Chinese parallels (SA 110 at T ii 35b4 and EA 37.10 at T ii 715b4), which do include the characteristic of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dukkha</i> here, would be a product of later expansion and normalization.
