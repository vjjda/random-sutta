It was instituted on the emotional request of the Buddha’s own father, who was distraught when his grandson Rāhula went forth while still a boy (<a href='index.html?q=pli-tv-kd1#54.4.2'>Kd 1:54.4.2</a>). It originally applied to novices, who went forth as young as fifteen or “when old enough to scare crows” (<a href='index.html?q=pli-tv-kd1#51.1.14'>Kd 1:51.1.14</a>). Over time the requirements for ordination tend to become stricter as things required in a particular context are applied generally. If this is the case here, the process must have happened quickly, so that even in the canonical full ordination procedure a candidate, who must be twenty years at least, must have permission of their parents (<a href='index.html?q=pli-tv-kd1#76.1.12'>Kd 1:76.1.12</a>). However, there are many people who cannot get such permission, such as orphans. Thus if one does give the going-forth to someone without permission of the parents, it is a minor offence of wrong-doing for the mendicant performing the ordination, but it does not invalidate it (<a href='index.html?q=pli-tv-kd1#54.6.5'>Kd 1:54.6.5</a>).
