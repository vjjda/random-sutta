At <a href='index.html?q=pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1#9.3.1'>Bu Pj 1:9.3.1</a>, I have translated the same compound as “enemy monks”. In that rule this seems required because various people who are acting as enemies of monks are mentioned separately, such as kings, bandits, and scoundrels. Moreover, all of these are compounded with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paccatthikā</i>: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhupaccatthikā</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rājapaccatthikā</i>, and so on. Since it seems reasonable to assume that all these compounds have the same structure, it follows that they should all be read as “enemies who are so-and-so” rather than “enemies of so-and-so”. This understanding is confirmed by Sp 1.58: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhū eva paccatthikā bhikkhupaccatthikā</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Bhikkhupaccatthikā</i> are just monks who are enemies.” In the present context, however, this interpretation does not seem to work. If <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhupaccatthikā</i> refers to enemies who are monks, then they would have to be invited to take part in the ceremony, or some other arrangement would have to be made, but nothing is said about this in either the Pali or the commentaries. Moreover, kings, bandits, and scoundrels are in this case not compounded with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paccatthikā</i>, as they are in Bu Pj 1. I therefore conclude that the meaning here must be “enemies of monks”. "},"pli-tv-kd2:24.3.5":{"pli":"‘iṅgha tumhe āyasmanto imaṃ bhikkhuṃ muhuttaṃ muñcatha, yāvāyaṃ bhikkhu uposathaṃ karotī’ti.
