Eventually, all five realized stream-entry and went forth officially as Buddhist mendicants. Knowing they were ready, he taught them about not-self. In the first discourse, the Buddha referred to the five aggregates “in brief”, and now he draws that teaching out in more detail.

Salvation from the travails of the world lies in realizing this essential truth. It follows that what is impermanent cannot be the self, because when it disappears the self would also disappear (<a href='index.html?q=dn15#29.4'>DN 15:29.4</a>). And what is suffering cannot be the self, because our true essence is free of impurities and thus essentially blissful, radiant, and all-knowing. This salvific self cannot be identified with something that brings only pain (<a href='index.html?q=sn22.60#5.1'>SN 22.60:5.1</a>). | This metaphysical “self” has only a contingent relationship with the empirical “self” of psychology or popular usage. The psychological self grows and changes, and must develop emotional wholeness and coherence for a person to become a healthy individual. If someone with a fractured psychological self latches on to the Buddhist teaching of no metaphysical self, they can easily mistake one for the other, leading to further disintegration of the psyche.
