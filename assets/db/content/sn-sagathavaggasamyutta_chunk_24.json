He seems, however, to be the Buddhist version of Brahmā Svayambhū, the “Self-born Divinity”, to whom Yājñavalkya traces the authority of his teaching lineage (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.6.3, 4.5.3, 6.5.4). Yājñavalkya identifies this “self-born” with the sun (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.9.3.16; see also Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.6.6) and with Prajāpati (13.5.3.1). Explaining the origin of the soma rite of the “All-Sacrifice”, he says that Brahmā Svayambhū, while performing fervent austerities, decided to offer his self to all creatures and all creatures to his self, thus establishing lordship (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhipatya</i>) over all creatures (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.7.1.1). The root <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pati</i> (“lord”) here establishes a linguistic link with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sahampati</i>. Further, in the earliest use of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>svayambhū</i> at Rig Veda 10.83.4, the “self-born” deity Manyu “prevails” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sahuriḥ sahāvān</i>) in battle. Thus we can identify Sahampati, the “Lord Who Prevails”, with the highest divinity recognized by Yājñavalkya, who originated as victor in battle, whose physical manifestation is the sun, whose spiritual function is to imbue all creatures with divinity, and who serves as the ultimate source of authority. Meanwhile, the epithet <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sayambhū</i> was taken for the Buddha (<a href='index.html?q=pli-tv-kd11#35.1.37'>Kd 11:35.1.37</a>).
