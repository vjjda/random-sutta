One school of Buddhism, the Pudgalavādins, argued that the “individual” was ultimately real but not defined, being neither identical with nor separate from the aggregates. This position was rejected by other schools, including the Theravada (<a href='index.html?q=kv1.1'>Kv 1.1</a>).

Also, Śāṅkhāyana Āraṇyaka 14.2 speaks of a student who repeats the Veda without understanding, like a pillar that merely “bears the burden” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhārahāra</i>), thus also referring to a person who has undertaken a responsibility.

Abruptly, the Suttas then use it some 3000 times for descriptions of “individuals” and their characteristics, especially in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, and collected in the Abhidhamma book Puggalapaññatti. Pali is rich in terms for “person”, so why did <i lang='pi' translate='no'>puggala</i> became so characteristic? The Jain meaning of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pudgala</i> is “particulate matter” (Tattvārthasūtra 5.5, Isibhāsiyam 1.31, Uttarādhyayanasūtra 28.12). They say “substantial reality” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>astikāya</i> = <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sakkāya</i>) includes “matter” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pudgala</i>), which is comprised of “atoms” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>anu</i>) and “molecules” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>skandha</i>). <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pudgala</i> is also used for an individual “article” (of gold) by Kauṭilya (Arthaśastra 2.14.7, 2.14.43). Further, we find the notion that beings are <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pudgalāśrayāḥ</i> (“comprised of a composite mass”, Viṣṇu Purāṇa 5.30.13) related to a criticism of those who assert not-self, i.e. Buddhists. Rarely, later Sanskrit references the meaning “body”. Thus <i lang='pi' translate='no'>puggala</i> approaches the same semantic field as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>khandha</i> (“aggregate”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāya</i> (“body”, from the root <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ci</i>, “heap”), which gives us <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sakkāya</i> (“substantial reality”, <a href='index.html?q=sn22.105'>SN 22.105</a> and notes), all three of which are technical terms in Buddhism and Jainism but not Vedism. Our findings support Paul Tedesco’s proposed derivation from <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pṛthak</i> (“Sanskrit pudgala—‘body, soul’”, Journal of the American Oriental Society 67, 1947, 172–7). Given that Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>puthu</i> combines the senses of Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pṛthu</i> (“expansive, manifold”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pṛthak</i> (“separate, individual”), the original sense was probably “composite individual” (cf. English “organism”). Perhaps the Buddha favored <i lang='pi' translate='no'>puggala</i> because it avoided Vedic terminology, while at the same time suggesting a connection with the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>khandha</i> doctrine that the “individual” comprised a “mass” of components.
