Rather than try to differentiate between these buildings, which is unlikely to be useful from a practical perspective, I have instead grouped them together as “stilt house”. Here is what the commentaries have to say.

Sp 4.294 continues: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Pāsādoti dīghapāsādo. Hammiyanti upariākāsatale patiṭṭhitakūṭāgāro pāsādoyeva</i>, “A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i> is a long stilt house. A <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hammiya</i> is just a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāsāda</i> that has an upper room on top of its flat roof.” At Sp-ṭ 3.74, however, we find slightly different explanations. It seems clear, however, that all three are stilt houses and that they are distinguished according to their shape and the kind of roof they possess.
