Several monks, meditating improperly on the unattractiveness of the body, sought suicide as the way out. In response, the Buddha taught mindfulness of breathing, which is “peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation”. | The idiomatic phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>satthahāraka</i> is difficult. The obvious reading is to take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sattha</i> as “knife”, the meaning it has in the preceding sentence. However, that yields the sense “knife-bringer”, “assassin”, whereas the use of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>idaṁ</i> in <a href='index.html?q=mn145#5.32'>MN 145:5.32</a> shows it must be neuter, i.e. it is a thing not a person. Richard Gombrich suggests we read <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sattha</i> here as equivalent to Sanskrit <i lang='pi' translate='no'>śvasita</i>, “breathing, life” (see Brahmali’s note on <a href='index.html?q=pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3#2.49.1'>Bu Pj 3:2.49.1</a>), yielding the sense “life-taker”, “breath-stealer”, “deadly weapon”. This agrees with the Vinaya commentary, which explains, “What does it take? Life.” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kiṃ harati? Jīvitaṁ</i>). Since this idiom is only used in the context of suicide, I call it “suicide weapon”, and the verbal form “commit suicide”.
