But it is not a description of sense experience. Rather, it describes how religious or spiritual beliefs come about, which is why smell, taste, and touch are omitted, and why it is introduced in this chapter. The truth, or what is believed to be the truth, is formulated from something “seen” (as a vision, or the sight of a pure being), “heard” (as teaching or scripture), “thought” (as philosophical reasoning), “known” (through understanding or meditation), or “attained, sought, and explored by the mind”, which specifically refer to meditative realization. Thus I propose referring to this set as the “epistemic heptad”. This is an extension of the more common epistemic tetrad, where meditative states are included under the “known” (<a href='index.html?q=mn1#19.1'>MN 1:19.1</a>).
