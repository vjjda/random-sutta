In later Buddhism the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>makara</i> is the name of a mythological marine animal, but what it refers to in this context is not clear. According to Sp-yoj 4.243 <i lang='pi' translate='no'>makara</i> is the name of a certain species of fish: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Makaradantaketi makaranāmakassa macchassa dantasadise dante</i>, “Teeth like the teeth of a fish called <i lang='pi' translate='no'>makara</i>.” Vin-vn-ṭ 3048, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Makaradantakanti girikūṭākāraṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Makaradantaka</i> means making (a design) like the peak of a hill.” PED suggests “the tooth of a swordfish”, but apparently swordfish do not have teeth. Given that the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>makara</i> were fearsome creatures and that their teeth looked like the peak of a hill, presumably meaning that their teeth were pointed, “shark teeth” seems like a reasonable approximation. | “The fivefold pattern” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pañcapaṭika</i>.
