The commentary explains it here as “vice, defilement”. But compare Rig Veda 10.112.10, where Indra the “bounteous” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>maghavan</i>) is urged to “battle” and bestow a share of winnings on devotees. Likewise at 10.113.4 Indra’s successful “battle” is a prelude to releasing the waters. Then there is the oft-quoted line <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhanañjayaṃ raṇe-raṇe</i> (“winner of the stakes in every battle”, 1.74.3, 6.16.15).

He also played a role in fertility (Rig Veda 7.36.9, 10.84.1). By the time of the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa he was identified with the sacrifice (eg. 1.1.2.13), and was said to be a dwarf, perhaps as the shrunken sun of dusk (1.2.5.5). In one passage he is mystically identified with Indra as Maghavan (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 14.1.1.13). | Just as the previous chapter featured Indra under several names, the deities in the next few Suttas may also be names of Vishnu, although the identifications are weak.
