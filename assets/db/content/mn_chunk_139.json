His name has a variety of spellings in Pali and Sanskrit, but the correct form is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāpaṭika</i> from <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kapaṭa</i>, “fraud”. Kauṭilya explains that fraudulent students (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>chātraḥ kāpaṭikaḥ</i>) were spies installed by kings to test the loyalty of subjects (Arthaśāstra 1.10.11, 1.11.1–2), for which they were paid handsomely (5.3.22). Note that the Buddha calls him Bhāradvāja; this follows the convention in Pali that brahmins of that name are distinguished by epithets, often unflattering: Bhāradvāja the Farmer (<a href='index.html?q=snp1.4#1.3'>Snp 1.4:1.3</a>), Bhāradvāja the Fire-Worshiper (<a href='index.html?q=snp1.7#1.4'>Snp 1.7:1.4</a>), Bhāradvāja the Alms-Gatherer (<a href='index.html?q=sn35.127#1.1'>SN 35.127:1.1</a>), Bhāradvāja the Builder (<a href='index.html?q=sn7.17#1.2'>SN 7.17:1.2</a>), Bhāradvāja the Rude (<a href='index.html?q=sn7.2#1.2'>SN 7.2:1.2</a>), Bhāradvāja the Fiend (<a href='index.html?q=sn7.3#1.2'>SN 7.3:1.2</a>), Bhāradvāja the Bitter (<a href='index.html?q=sn7.4#1.2'>SN 7.4:1.2</a>), and so on. Thus Kāpaṭika would have been an epithet recognizing that he was the king’s spy, a practice to which Pasenadi openly admits (<a href='index.html?q=sn3.11#7.1'>SN 3.11:7.1</a>, <a href='index.html?q=ud6.2#8.1'>Ud 6.2:8.1</a>). This was the downside of building a religious institution on the king’s largess.
