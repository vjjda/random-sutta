But when this All has become the Self, how and what would one see? How and what would one smell, taste, greet, hear, think, touch, or cognize? By what would one cognize that which cognizes this All? This Self is not that, not that! … By what would one cognize the cognizer?” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.14 = 4.5.15; readings vary). According to the Buddha, the dualistic structure of experience is primary; the mind functions as a duality. If one asserts, with Yājñavalkya, that “there is no second reality here that he could see as something distinct and separate from himself” (BU 4.3.23), how can one then assert that the primordial person split in two to make man and woman (BU 1.4.3); or that there is a duality of truth and falsehood (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.1.1.4)? Yājñavalkya denies the duality of self and other implicit in the structure of the senses, yet asserts the dualities of truth and falsehood, mortality and immortality, and man and woman. The implication is that such an assertion is incoherent, for to make such an assertion relies on the duality of speech and the senses. For all his “nondual” talk, Yājñavalkya ends up asserting one axis of duality, namely the eternal survival of the soul (as at <a href='index.html?q=sn12.15#2.1'>SN 12.15:2.1</a>) against the transience of worldly things. While there is no <em>necessary</em> correspondence between the dualities of interior/exterior and eternalism/annihilationism, those who focus on the inner consciousness, which appears to the unwary as ever-present, tend to fall into eternalism, while those who focus on the ephemeral material world of the exterior senses tend to be annihilationists.

It arises as an individuated self from the mass of particularized elements making up the world, but for the realized being it returns to its essential oneness with Divinity. Thus Yājñavalkya spoke of the “uncognized cognizer”, the eternal and changeless core of awareness at the heart of the ephemeral world of changing illusions.
