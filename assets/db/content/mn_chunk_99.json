As the community grew, the Buddha authorized the Saṅgha to perform the “going forth and ordination” (<a href='index.html?q=pli-tv-kd1#12.1.1'>Kd 1:12.1.1</a>). Later still, the novice (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sāmaṇera</i>) platform was introduced for teenagers and became known as “going forth” (<a href='index.html?q=pli-tv-kd1#54.3.2'>Kd 1:54.3.2</a>).
