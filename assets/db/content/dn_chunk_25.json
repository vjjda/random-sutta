One meaning of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nāṭa</i> is “dance”, and one of the unique features of this discourse is that each of the Four Great Kings is said to delight in song and dance. There is a long history of dancing divinities in India, and images of dancers go back as far as the Indus Valley Civilization. If we take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nāṭa</i> in the sense “the people of the dance”, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kusināṭā</i> would therefore be “dancers of the grass” after the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kusa</i> grass essential to the Vedic rites of kingship. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Parakusināṭā</i> is the “further dancers of the grass”, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>parakusiṭanāṭā</i> is probably a variation on that. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Nāṭapuriyā</i> is the “citadel of the dancers”. Each of these associates the people of the dance with the idea of protection or authority, agreeing with the context, where the cities are said to belong to a great king. Thus the prefix <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āṭā-</i> probably stems from <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tāṇa</i> (“shelter, refuge”; the same root as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>paritta</i>), in the sense of the “refuge of the dancers”.
