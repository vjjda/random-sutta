It is not always possible to determine which sense applies. As to the connotations of the term, the commentary says it is any human woman, even one born that very day. Probably the term “mother” is meant in an affectionate and respectful sense, perhaps to remind the monks not to fall into objectification (cf. <a href='index.html?q=sn35.127#1.6'>SN 35.127:1.6</a>). This thesis claims weak support from the observation that throughout the Pātimokkha—the quintessential text for monks—<i lang='pi' translate='no'>mātugāma</i> is used in apposition with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bhikkhu</i>, whereas <i lang='pi' translate='no'>itthī</i> (“woman”<i lang='pi' translate='no'>) is used with </i>purisa<i lang='pi' translate='no'> (“man”).
