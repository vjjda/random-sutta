Syntactically, it is a locative absolute construction, which Bodhi treats as conditional: “there being a suitable basis”. However this does not readily account for the repeated <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sati</i>, which he takes as the locative present participle from the verb <i lang='pi' translate='no'>atthi</i> (“being”). Ānandajoti, by contrast, takes the first <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sati</i> as “being” and the second as “mindfulness”, and treats the absolute construction as temporal: “while there is a basis for mindfulness”. Further, both accept the commentary’s gloss of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āyatana</i> as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kāraṇa</i> (“reason, basis”), although this sense of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āyatana</i> is rare in the suttas (but see <a href='index.html?q=sn12.25#14.3'>SN 12.25:14.3</a> = <a href='index.html?q=an4.171#5.3'>AN 4.171:5.3</a>). These readings of the absolute construction give it a limiting sense; the benefits apply only insofar as there is a “suitable basis” or a “basis for mindfulness”. But the expression is used by the Buddha of himself (<a href='index.html?q=an5.68#1.9'>AN 5.68:1.9</a>), so it seems odd that it would be limiting. Indeed, the tenor of the whole sentence is not limiting but expansive, as emphasized by the repeated reduplications: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>yassa yassa … tatra tatreva … sati sati</i>, which have a distributive sense. I therefore take <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sati</i> as “being” in both cases; the reduplication of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sati</i> as aligned with the preceding pronouns, emphasizing universality; the locative absolute as causal; and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>āyatana</i>  in its normal sense of “scope, range”.
