As to the protagonist of <a href='index.html?q=snp4.9'>Snp 4.9</a>, the Pali commentary, Divyāvadāna 36—which calls him Mākandika—and the Chinese parallel in the Arthapada (T iv 180) say he too was from the Kuru country. Now, the Mahābhārata and other Sanskrit sources name Mākandī as a city or province on the banks of the Ganges, in the Pañcāla kingdom south of Hastināpura. This more-or-less agrees with Māgaṇḍiya’s home in the Kuru country, and suggests his name means “the man from Mākandī”. Divyāvadāna 36 and Sanskrit fragment say the Mākandika of <a href='index.html?q=snp4.9'>Snp 4.9</a> was also a wanderer, which does not contradict the position of the Pali commentaries and the Arthapada that he was a brahmin.

This story could well have begun life as a comic inversion of <a href='index.html?q=snp4.9'>Snp 4.9</a>. Reading all these sources together, we can posit that there was a brahmin wanderer from Mākandī on the Ganges in Kuru-Pañcāla, who gained a certain fame and following as a teacher, but whose hedonism was his downfall. The Pali commentaries further specify that the Māgaṇḍiya of the current sutta is the nephew of the one at <a href='index.html?q=snp4.9'>Snp 4.9</a>.
