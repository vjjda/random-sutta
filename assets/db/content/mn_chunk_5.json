","html":"<p>{}","comm":"Readings include <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vacīsaṁsāro</i>, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vacīsaṁhāro</i>, and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vacīsaṅkhāro</i>. <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Vacīsaṁsāro</i> is found, without recorded variants, in the parallel passage at <a href='index.html?q=an2.63#1.1'>AN 2.63:1.1</a>. The commentary here glosses with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vacanasañcāro</i>, while the subcommentary to AN 2.63 has <i lang='pi' translate='no'>pavattamānā</i>, both of which support the dominant reading <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vacīsaṁsāro</i>. Their explanations differ, however as the commentary here explains as spreading rumors from one place to another, while at AN 2.63 it is said to be ongoing arguing. Since the normal meaning of <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁsāra</i> is “endless ongoing”, and since, in both MN and AN, this follows a passage where disputes were supposed to have been settled, perhaps the sense is “continuing to bring up matters that have been settled”.
