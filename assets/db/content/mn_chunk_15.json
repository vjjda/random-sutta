The commentary offers a couple of explanations, one of which, attributed to “overseas Elders”, says the text should include a passage on the four nutriments. As it happens, the Chinese parallel does indeed include the four nutriments (MA 187 at T i 732b18), confirming the suggestion of the “overseas Elders” (Anālayo, <em>Comparative Study</em>, vol. ii, p. 638). Thus an accurate memory of the text persisted in the commentarial tradition, even when the text itself suffered loss. As to the identity of these Elders, the commentary to the Ghaṭikārasutta (<a href='index.html?q=mn81#10.5'>MN 81:10.5</a>) says they taught the ten perfections (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>pāramī</i>). These are a characteristic doctrine of the Mahāvihāra (or Theravāda) school, as other sectarian accounts of the perfections rarely number ten. So we can assume the Elders were not of a different school. Inscriptions at Amarāvatī and Nāgārjunikoṇḍa reveal that there was a Mahāvihāra branch monastery in Andhra, so they may have lived there.
