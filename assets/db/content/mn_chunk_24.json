","html":"{}","comm":"This passage raises the question as to how such a reflection leads to rebirth in the Brahmā realms, which requires the development of absorption (eg. <a href='index.html?q=an4.123'>AN 4.123</a>). Similar passages take care to specify that in order to be reborn in the Brahmā realm, one must not only be ethical, but “free of desire”, by which they imply the practice of absorption (<a href='index.html?q=dn33#3.1.136'>DN 33:3.1.136</a> = <a href='index.html?q=an8.35#4.11'>AN 8.35:4.11</a>). Related passages in Chinese translation relate the development of different levels of absorption to rebirth in the various realms (MA 168 at T i 700c7; Dharmaskandha, T 1537 at T xxvi 506b14), as does the commentary to this sutta. Now, while the current sutta does not mention absorption, it may be considered in light of the meditation practice of the six recollections. One of these is the recollection that the deities, including Brahmās, were reborn due to their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom—exactly the same qualities mentioned in the present sutta (<a href='index.html?q=an6.25#6.3'>AN 6.25:6.3</a>). Thus when the present sutta says to “settle on that thought, concentrate on it, and develop it”, the phrase <i lang='pi' translate='no'>cittaṁ bhāveti</i> implies more than simply “developing the thought” of the aspiration, but means “developing the mind”. In the suttas this implies deep meditation, as for example the case of a teacher of the past, Sunetta, who was “free of desire”; after “developing the mind of love” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>mettaṁ cittaṁ bhāvetvā</i>) he was reborn in the Brahmā realm (<a href='index.html?q=an7.66#13.1'>AN 7.66:13.1</a>). Thus we can interpret the present passage as a way of practicing recollection of the deities, recalling that one’s virtuous qualities are shared with the deities, and developing deep meditation based on the joy that brings.
