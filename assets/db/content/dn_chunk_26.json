Readings vary between <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hīne vimuttaṁ</i> (“released in what is inferior”, per MS) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hīne ’dhimuttaṁ</i> (“resolved upon what is inferior”). This is an example of an ambiguity between <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vi + √muc</i> (“release”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhi + √muc</i> (“resolve”) that is sometimes seen in Pali texts. The subcommentary reads <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vimuttaṁ</i> and offers two explanations: “‘Released’ (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vimuttaṁ</i>) means ‘resolved’ (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhimuttaṁ</i>); the meaning is slants, slopes, and inclines. Or else ‘released’ means ‘set free’ (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vissaṭṭhaṁ</i>).” Given that it is clearly accepted in the commentarial tradition, and that it is the more difficult reading, it seems we must accept <i lang='pi' translate='no'>vimuttaṁ</i> as the correct reading here. But from context, and from the subcommentary, it has the same sense as <i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhimutta</i>, namely, “resolved upon”. This goes some way to explaining the ambiguity between the two words, as they not only have a similar form, but their meanings can overlap too.
