It supplies the verbs that are missing from the bare nouns in the standard sequence: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>hoti</i> (“is” or “comes to be”) and <i lang='pi' translate='no'>uppajjati</i> (“arises”). The two phrases use complementary ways of specifying a causal relationship: the first employs the locative absolute to emphasize the <em>presence</em> of the antecedent condition; the second the ablative to emphasize the <em>derivation</em> of the subsequent condition. These two linguistic forms are also used for the twelve links themselves: the normal sequence, as here, uses the ablative form; sometimes we find the locative absolute form (eg. <a href='index.html?q=sn12.49'>SN 12.49</a>); sometimes both (eg. <a href='index.html?q=sn12.4#15.2'>SN 12.4:15.2</a>). | Later, the abstract principle was sometimes referred to as “specific conditionality” in contrast to the twelve links which are “dependent origination”.
