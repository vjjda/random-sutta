This is puzzling because where we find this trope elsewhere there is a clear reason: at <a href='index.html?q=an7.52#1.3'>AN 7.52:1.3</a> the Buddha was making one of his rare visits to Campā, while at <a href='index.html?q=sn22.81#3.5'>SN 22.81:3.5</a> he had left the squabbling Sangha for the seclusion of the forest. Here, in the central teaching location of Sāvatthī, there is no such reason. Rather, the events are best understood as narrative foreshadowing. His reluctance requires an intervention by others, and when the teaching finally takes place it is not in a Buddhist monastery but on Brahmanical grounds. The story goes on to tell how, after his awakening, he was reluctant to teach until the intervention of Brahmā (<a href='index.html?q=mn26#19.1'>MN 26:19.1</a>). This narrative mirroring creates a hidden link (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>sandhi</i>) that frames the awakening in a Brahmanical context. The very obscurity of the connection is the point, for “the gods love hidden things”. The theme of reluctance is extended further to the reluctance of the five mendicants to receive the Buddha. It draws on the precedent of Yājñavalkya’s reluctance to teach Janaka (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.3.1).

","html":"<p>{}</p>","comm":"In Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12 and 4.5.13, the sage Yājñavalkya says that the true Self is a sheer mass of “consciousness” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vijñāna</i>, Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>viññāṇa</i>), which is “great, endless, infinite reality”. After realizing this, he says, there is no “perception” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṁjñā</i>, Pali <i lang='pi' translate='no'>saññā</i>). This passage seems to have sparked the conversation at <a href='index.html?q=dn9#6.4'>DN 9:6.4</a>, where the Buddha goes on to speak of meditative training to refine perception. Notably, there he mentions all the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>jhānas</i> and formless attainments <em>except</em> the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, which is beyond the topic of perception under discussion. This meditative state may be related to the state with “no perception” spoken of by Yājñavalkya. However, it is not possible to literally identify such subtle meditative states on such slender evidence. The point is simply that the contemplative brahmins of the Upaniṣadic tradition of Yājñavalkya did indeed describe their highest state in terms of perception.

This passage confirms that this usage carries over from the Brahmanical tradition, where it is a common term in the same sense. Thus Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.1.2 speaks of “mother, father, and teacher”, while Chāndogya Upaniṣad 2.23.1 enjoins a student to “live with the teacher until death”, and at 4.9.1 ff. we see the journey of a student to their teacher’s house, where he is looked after by the teacher and his wife.

Yājñavalkya identifies this “self-born” with the sun (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 1.9.3.16; see also Maitrāyaṇī Saṁhitā 4.6.6) and with Prajāpati (13.5.3.1). Explaining the origin of the soma rite of the “All-Sacrifice”, he says that Brahmā Svayambhū, while performing fervent austerities, decided to offer his self to all creatures and all creatures to his self, thus establishing lordship (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhipatya</i>) over all creatures (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.7.1.1).
