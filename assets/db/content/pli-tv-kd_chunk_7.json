It is where three or four holes are made for inserting bolts.” Whenever the Canonical text lists the parts of a door and door frame, the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aggaḷavaṭṭi</i> always has the same position, being grouped together with the parts for the locking mechanism, such as latches and bolts. Given the commentarial explanation, it is natural to think that it was a special post added to the door frame, or perhaps replacing the door frame, for the purpose of receiving bolts. “Bolt socket” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kapisīsaka</i>. Sp 4.260: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Kapisīsakaṁ nāma dvārabāhaṁ vijjhitvā tattha pavesito aggaḷapāsako vuccati</i>, “The bolt-receiving socket which is inserted after piercing the door post is called a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>kapisīsaka</i>.” “Bolt” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>sūcika</i>. Sp 4.260: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Sūcikāti tattha majjhe chiddaṁ katvā pavesitā</i>, “It is entered, having made a hole in the middle there.” “Latch” renders <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ghaṭika</i>. Sp-ṭ 4.255: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Ghaṭikanti upari yojitaṁ aggaḷaṁ</i>, “<i lang='pi' translate='no'>Ghaṭika</i>: it connected the door at the top.” From the origin story to <a href='index.html?q=pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2#1.1.11'>Bu Ss 2:1.1.11</a> it seems that the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ghaṭika</i> was a device that could be opened with a key: <i lang='pi' translate='no'>Avāpuraṇaṁ ādāya ghaṭikaṁ ugghāṭetvā kavāṭaṁ paṇāmetvā vihāraṁ pāvisi</i>, “(Udāyī) took the key, lifted the latch, opened the door, and entered the dwelling.” It follows from this that the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>ghaṭika</i> is unlikely to be a bolt, but probably a kind of bar, like a latch, that would require lifting for the door to open. The lifting would be done with <i lang='pi' translate='no'>tāḷa</i>, a key-like device, for which see below.
