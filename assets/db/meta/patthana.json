The Dhammasaṅgaṇī and the Paṭṭhāna bookend the Abhidhamma collection, the first dealing with phenomena, the latter with their relations. While method and the details have expanded considerably, the approach can be seen as a detailed application of the underlying principles of dependent origination.","nav":{"prev":"ya"}},"patthana11.9":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 11.9","original_title":"Kusalattika, Sanidassanattika","nav":{"prev":"patthana11.8","next":"patthana11.10"},"chunk":23},"patthana8.30":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 8.30","original_title":"Ganthaganthasampayuttaduka","nav":{"prev":"patthana8.29","next":"patthana8.31"},"chunk":73},"patthana9.16":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 9.16","original_title":"Saraṇaduka, Vedanāttikādi","nav":{"prev":"patthana9.15","next":"patthana9.17"},"chunk":75},"patthana16.51":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 16.51","original_title":"Sanidassanattika, Nahetusahetukaduka","nav":{"prev":"patthana16.50","next":"patthana16.52"},"chunk":30},"patthana11.4":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 11.4","original_title":"Kusalattika, Saṁkiliṭṭhattika","nav":{"prev":"patthana11.3","next":"patthana11.5"},"chunk":23},"patthana12.7":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 12.7","original_title":"Sahetukadukādi, Hetuduka","nav":{"prev":"patthana12.6","next":"patthana12.8"},"chunk":24},"patthana23.50":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 23.50","original_title":"Sanidassanattika, Parittattika","nav":{"prev":"patthana23.49","next":"patthana23.51"},"chunk":52},"patthana14.7":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 14.7","original_title":"Sappaccayadukādi","nav":{"prev":"patthana14.6","next":"patthana14.8"},"chunk":26},"patthana23.7":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 23.7","original_title":"Kusalattika, Dassanattika","nav":{"prev":"patthana23.6","next":"patthana23.8"},"chunk":52},"patthana15.41":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 15.41","original_title":"Cittasampayuttaduka, Kusalattika","nav":{"prev":"patthana15.40","next":"patthana15.42"},"chunk":27},"patthana18.29":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 18.29","original_title":"Saraṇaduka, Dassanenapahātabbadukādi","nav":{"prev":"patthana18.28","next":"patthana19.1"},"chunk":33},"patthana3.8":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 3.8","original_title":"Nīvaraṇagocchaka, Kusalattika","nav":{"prev":"patthana3.7","next":"patthana3.9"},"chunk":62},"patthana1.5":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 1.5","translated_title":"Clinging Triplet","original_title":"Upādinnattika","nav":{"prev":"patthana1.4","next":"patthana1.6"},"chunk":16},"patthana14.30":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 14.30","original_title":"Savitakkadukādi","nav":{"prev":"patthana14.29","next":"patthana14.31"},"chunk":26},"patthana11.13":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 11.13","original_title":"Upādinnattika, Kusalattika","nav":{"prev":"patthana11.12","next":"patthana11.14"},"chunk":22},"patthana18.6":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 18.6","original_title":"Hetuduka, Saññojanagocchakādi","nav":{"prev":"patthana18.5","next":"patthana18.7"},"chunk":33},"patthana16.11":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 16.11","original_title":"Kusalattika, Lokiyaduka","nav":{"prev":"patthana16.10","next":"patthana16.12"},"chunk":29},"patthana16.68":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 16.68","original_title":"Sanidassanattika, Cittasampayuttaduka","nav":{"prev":"patthana16.67","next":"patthana16.69"},"chunk":31},"patthana11.14":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 11.14","original_title":"Saṁkiliṭṭhattika, Kusalattika","nav":{"prev":"patthana11.13","next":"patthana11.15"},"chunk":22},"patthana24.3":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 24.3","original_title":"Hetuduka, Cūḷantaraduka","nav":{"prev":"patthana24.2","next":"patthana24.4"},"chunk":53},"patthana1.10":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 1.10","translated_title":"Triplet of (State) Together with Root Eradicated by First Path","original_title":"Dassanenapahātabbahetukattika","nav":{"prev":"patthana1.9","next":"patthana1.11"},"chunk":1},"patthana15.59":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Patthana 15.59","original_title":"Sappītikaduka, Kusalattika","nav":{"prev":"patthana15.58","next":"patthana15.60"},"chunk":28},"ya":{"type":"branch","acronym":"Ya","translated_title":"The Pairs ","original_title":"Yamaka","blurb":"The Yamaka (Pairs) consists of ten chapters on different topics, starting with the roots of wholesome or unwholesome conduct.
