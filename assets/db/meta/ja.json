Arrived at Jetavana, they sat awhile in the several enclosures—in the enclosure of the Iron-wood trees, in the enclosure of the Sal-trees, and so forth,—till at evening the Master passed from his fragrant sweet-smelling perfumed chamber to the Hall of Truth and took his seat on the gorgeous Buddha-seat. Then, with their following, these young men went to the Hall of Truth, made an offering of perfumes and flowers, bowed down at his feet—those blessed feet that were glorious as full-blown lotus-flowers, and bore imprinted on the sole the Wheel!—and, taking their seats, listened to the Truth. Then the thought came into their minds, “Let us take the vows, so far as we understand the Truth preached by the Master.” Accordingly, when the Blessed One left the Hall, they approached him and with due obeisance asked to be admitted to the Brotherhood; and the Master admitted them to the Brotherhood. Winning the favour of their teachers and directors they received full Brotherhood, and after five years’ residence with their teachers and directors, by which time they had got by heart the two Abstracts, had come to know what was proper and what was improper, had learnt the three modes of expressing thanks, and had stitched and dyed robes. At this stage, wishing to embrace the ascetic life, they obtained the consent of their teachers and directors, and approached the Master. Bowing before him they took their seats, saying, “Sir, we are troubled by the round of existence, dismayed by birth, decay, disease, and death; give us a theme, by thinking on which we may get free from the elements which occasion existence.” The Master turned over in his mind the eight and thirty themes of thought, and therefrom selected a suitable one, which he expounded to them. And then, after getting their theme from the Master, they bowed and with a ceremonious farewell passed from his presence to their cells, and after gazing on their teachers and directors went forth with bowl and robe to embrace the ascetic life.","nav":{"prev":"ja70","next":"ja72"},"chunk":59},"ja394":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Ja 394","translated_title":"Vattaka Jātaka","original_title":"Vaṭṭakajātaka","blurb":"“Oil and butter”—The Master told this while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a greedy Brother.

But on this occasion the Master addressed his kinsfolk, saying, “It is meet, sire, that kinsfolk should dwell together in concord and unity. For, when kinsfolk are at one, enemies find no opportunity. Not to speak of human beings, even sense-lacking trees ought to stand together. For in bygone days in the Himalayas a tempest struck a Sal-forest; yet, because the trees, shrubs, bushes, and creepers of that forest were interlaced one with another, the tempest could not overthrow even a single tree but passed harmlessly over their heads. But alone in a courtyard stood a mighty tree; and though it had many stems and branches, yet, because it was not united with other trees, the tempest uprooted it and laid it low. Wherefore, it is meet that you too should dwell together in concord and unity.” And so saying, at their request he told this story of the past.","nav":{"prev":"ja73","next":"ja75"},"chunk":59},"ja294":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Ja 294","translated_title":"Jambu-Khadaka Jātaka","original_title":"Jambukhādakajātaka","blurb":"“Who is it sits”—This story the Master told at the Bamboo-grove, about Devadatta and Kokalika.","nav":{"prev":"ja293","next":"ja295"},"chunk":6},"ja353":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Ja 353","translated_title":"Dhonasakha Jātaka","original_title":"Venasākhajātaka","blurb":"“‘Though thou art now”—This story the Master, while living in the Bhesakala grove near Sumsumaragiri (Mount Crocodile) in the country of the Bhaggas, told concerning young prince Bodhi.","nav":{"prev":"ja352","next":"ja354"},"chunk":9},"ja285":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Ja 285","translated_title":"Manisukara Jātaka","original_title":"Maṇisūkarajātaka","blurb":"“To hell shall go he”—This story the Master told at Jetavana, about the murder of Sundari.","nav":{"prev":"ja284","next":"ja286"},"chunk":6},"ja85":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Ja 85","translated_title":"Kimpakka Jātaka","original_title":"Kiṁpakkajātaka","blurb":"“As they who ate.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana, about a concupiscent Brother.

The canonical Pali collection consists of verses arranged in numbered sets in the Aṅguttara fashion. The shorter sets illustrate a high point of a story, while the longer sets tell a complete story. These verses would have been passed down from the beginning with prose narrative to flesh out the story, which in the Pali is now found in the commentary. It is in the commentary that we find the explicit connection between the stories of the past and the present day, identifying the hero of the tale with the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>bodhisattva</i> and the major protagonists with the Buddha’s contemporaries. This collection is the main source of Jātakas, but there are many similar stories found elsewhere in the Pali canon (a few in the four <i lang='pi' translate='no'>nikāyas</i>, others in the Cariyapiṭaka) and throughout the Chinese, Tibetan, and Sanskrit texts. Most of the Jātakas began life as folk tales or myths, drops from the vast ocean of story in oral culture. Several Jātakas record versions of famous Hindu myths, while others share a common basis with European folk tales. The verse forms in the Jātakas are mostly of the earlier kinds, and the social and political reflect historical realities in the centuries before the Buddha, where, for example, Varanasi was an independent kingdom. The Jātakas are the oldest, largest, and best-preserved collection of ancient stories found anywhere in the world. One of the central themes is renunciation, with multiple stories depicting the hero going-forth from the home, each time from a different perspective. Jātakas generally illustrate moral messages, but since the hero is supposed to be imperfect, it is not unusual for him to be portrayed as making dubious choices, even breaking precepts. Taken as a whole, the Jātaka literature is a vast tapestry of story illustrating the twisting and uncertain path to Awakening. The Jātaka genre proved a popular and effective framework for incorporating popular tales into a Buddhist context. They feature prominently in Buddhist art both ancient and modern, and are a primary means of introducing Buddhism to children in modern Theravāda.","nav":{"prev":"cp","next":"mnd"}},"ja7":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Ja 7","translated_title":"The King and the Stick-Collector","original_title":"Kaṭṭhahārijātaka","author_uid":"sujato","blurb":"“Your son am I.”—This story was told by the Master while at Jetavana about the story of Vasabha-Khattiya, which will be found in the Twelfth Book in the Bhaddasala-jataka.","nav":{"prev":"ja6","next":"ja8"},"chunk":59},"ja-asampadanavagga":{"type":"branch","translated_title":"Refusing a Gift","original_title":"Asampadānavagga","nav":{"prev":"ja-kusanalivagga","next":"ja-kakantakavagga"}},"ja484":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Ja 484","translated_title":"Salikedara Jātaka","original_title":"Sālikedārajātaka","blurb":"“The crop of rice”—This was a story the Master told while dwelling at Jetavana, about a Brother who supported his mother.
