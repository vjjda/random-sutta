a little later. It is a pair with the Therīgāthā, the “Verses of the Senior Nuns”. These verses celebrate the joy of freedom and the life of meditation in the forest. Together these collections constitute one of the oldest and largest collections of contemplative literature, preserving the unique voices of hundreds of early practitioners. Based on style and content, these collections belong to the early discourses. They are referred to on occasion in the northern canons, but no parallel collections have survived.","nav":{"prev":"pv","next":"thig"}},"thag1.30":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Thag

These verses celebrate the bliss of freedom and the life of meditation, full of proud and joyous proclamations of their spiritual attainments and their gratitude to other nuns as guides and teachers. The Therīgāthā is one of the oldest spiritual texts recording only women’s voices. It is a pair with the Theragāthā, the “Verses of the Senior Monks”. Together these collections constitute one of the oldest and largest collections of contemplative literature. Based on style and content, these collections belong to the early discourses. They are referred to on occasion in the northern canons, but no parallel collections have survived."}}}
