The list of topics is closely related to the Saṁyutta Nikāya—aggregates, senses, dependent origination, etc. Most of the chapters have a threefold structure. (1) Analysis according to the suttas: this quotes a key passage from the suttas on the relvant topic and offers a modest analysis. (2) Analysis according to the Abhidhamma: applies the sets of synonyms and terms as developed in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī. (3) Catechism: tests the students knowledge with systematic questioning. A few sections, such as Vb 18 Dhammahadaya, do not fit this system. They may have originated as independent treatises."},"pp":{"type":"branch","acronym":"Pp","translated_title":"Description of Personality Types ","original_title":"Puggalapaññatti","blurb":"The Puggalapaññatti (Designation of Person) departs from the strictly phenomenological approach of most Abhidhamma texts to present a compendium of passages relating to different kinds of individual.

As suggested by the numerical arrangement, these terms are mostly derived from the Aṅguttara Nikāya, with modest changes in wording. The main concern is to classify personal or psychological tendencies as they relate to the development of the Buddhist path."}}}
