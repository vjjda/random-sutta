The Vibhaṅga is divided into eight chapters, each dealing with a separate class of rules, grouped according to the offense incurred in breaking them, with the exception of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aniyatas</i> (“the undetermined”) and the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhikaraṇasamathadhamma</i> (“the principles for resolving legal issues”), which are principles to be applied rather than rules in the strict sense. Each rule together with its explanatory material forms an independent unit, a sub-chapter. These units begin with one or more origin stories, which tell the circumstances that led the Buddha to lay down a particular rule. The rule is then stated, followed by a word commentary that analyzes every significant word contained in the rule. After the word commentary follows a permutation series in which a variety of different scenarios are evaluated and offenses assigned as appropriate. At the end comes a non-offense clause, stating important exceptions to the rule, sometimes followed by individual case studies, in which the Buddha decides the offense incurred in ambiguous cases.","nav":{"prev":"kn","next":"pli-tv-bi-vb"}},"pc56":{"type":"alias","target_uid":"pli-tv-bu-vb-pc56"},"pli-tv-bu-vb-np27":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Bu Np 27","translated_title":"27.

The rule is then stated, followed by a word commentary that analyzes every significant word contained in the rule. After the word commentary follows a permutation series in which a variety of different scenarios are evaluated and offenses assigned as appropriate. At the end comes a non-offense clause, stating important exceptions to the rule, sometimes followed by individual case studies, in which the Buddha decides the offense incurred in ambiguous cases."}}}
