This term was introduced in the first sermon as the summary of the noble truth of suffering, and became a foundational teaching in all forms of Buddhism. The basic idea of an “aggregate” is a set or class of phenomena. The five are form (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpa</i>, i.e. “physical phenomena”, or sometimes simply “body”; note that in Buddhism, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpa</i> includes all things with material properties such as shape and color, including visions perceived only in the mind), feeling (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vedanā</i>, i.e. the pleasant, painful, or neutral tone of experience), perception (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saññā</i>, i.e. the recognition or interpretation of experience, <em>not</em> sense awareness), choices (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅkhārā</i>, i.e. intention, will, or volition; the choice to perform an act, especially one with an ethical dimension), and consciousness (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>viññāṇa</i>, i.e. the subjective process of awareness itself). The “aggregates” are the various different phenomena so classified. Almost always, they are referred to as the “aggregates connected with grasping” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>upādānakkhandha</i>). The relation between “grasping” and “aggregate” encompasses a number of aspects. The aggregates are the <em>subject</em> of grasping, in that they are the things that are normally attached to and taken to be the permanent “self”. But they are not merely passive spectators: they are also the <em>functional support</em> of grasping, the things that make grasping work. As active participants in the process of grasping, they <em>stimulate</em> grasping to themselves (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>upādāniya</i>). And finally, they are the <em>product</em> of grasping in the sense that attachments in past lives have given rise to the aggregates in this life (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>upādinna</i>). One of the key functions of the aggregates is to categorize theories of the self. From the discourses, non-Buddhists seem to be familiar with this, yet we cannot identify the aggregates in any pre-Buddhist texts. Regardless of whether the set of categories was pre-Buddhist, the Buddha treated them in his own distinctive way, emphasizing that nothing in the aggregates was a permanent self or soul. In this collection we find a large number of striking and lively narratives, showing how the aggregates could be a solace at the time of death, a guide to the knotty theoretical debates on identity, or a framework for insight meditation. Many of the short abbreviated texts are built from the same templates employed in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields”.","nav":{"prev":"sn21","next":"sn23"}},"sn11-tatiyavagga":{"type":"branch","translated_title":"Chapter Three","original_title":"Tatiyavagga","nav":{"prev":"sn11-dutiyavagga","next":"sn12-buddhavagga"}},"sn-sagathavaggasamyutta":{"type":"branch","translated_title":"The Group of Linked Discourses With Verses","original_title":"Sagāthāvaggasaṁyutta","blurb":"The “Book With Verses” is the first of the five books of the Linked Discourses.

In some cases, notably the Sakkasaṁyutta, the narrative element is developed into a lively exchange. Some of the texts in this collection are well known and widely quoted, such as the invitation of Brahmā or the nun Vajirā’s simile of the person as a chariot.

This collection has a full parallel in the Saṁyuktāgama (SA) of the Sarvāstivāda school in Chinese translation.
