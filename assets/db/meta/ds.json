The first of the triple sets is the momentous group: wholesome, unwholesome, and undetermined. This serves as a framework for classifying all the various phenomena.

Originally, however, the Pātimokkha probably existed as an independent text, known as the Pātimokkha-sutta.

(2) Analysis according to the Abhidhamma: applies the sets of synonyms and terms as developed in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī. (3) Catechism: tests the students knowledge with systematic questioning. A few sections, such as Vb 18 Dhammahadaya, do not fit this system. They may have originated as independent treatises."}}}
