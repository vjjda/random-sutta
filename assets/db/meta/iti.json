The collection as a whole is somewhat late; it is not found in northern scriptures, and some portions, such as the opening verses of the Nālaka Sutta, belong to the latest strata of the early texts. Nevertheless, certain sections—the “Rhinoceros Horn”, the “Chapter of the Eights”, and the “Way to the Beyond”—appear to have existed before being gathered into the collection, and are regarded as early. While the collection as a whole has no counterpart elsewhere, several portions have parallels in Chinese or Sanskrit."}}}
