This term was introduced in the first sermon as the summary of the noble truth of suffering, and became a foundational teaching in all forms of Buddhism. The basic idea of an “aggregate” is a set or class of phenomena. The five are form (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpa</i>, i.e. “physical phenomena”, or sometimes simply “body”; note that in Buddhism, <i lang='pi' translate='no'>rūpa</i> includes all things with material properties such as shape and color, including visions perceived only in the mind), feeling (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>vedanā</i>, i.e. the pleasant, painful, or neutral tone of experience), perception (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saññā</i>, i.e. the recognition or interpretation of experience, <em>not</em> sense awareness), choices (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>saṅkhārā</i>, i.e. intention, will, or volition; the choice to perform an act, especially one with an ethical dimension), and consciousness (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>viññāṇa</i>, i.e. the subjective process of awareness itself). The “aggregates” are the various different phenomena so classified. Almost always, they are referred to as the “aggregates connected with grasping” (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>upādānakkhandha</i>). The relation between “grasping” and “aggregate” encompasses a number of aspects. The aggregates are the <em>subject</em> of grasping, in that they are the things that are normally attached to and taken to be the permanent “self”. But they are not merely passive spectators: they are also the <em>functional support</em> of grasping, the things that make grasping work. As active participants in the process of grasping, they <em>stimulate</em> grasping to themselves (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>upādāniya</i>). And finally, they are the <em>product</em> of grasping in the sense that attachments in past lives have given rise to the aggregates in this life (<i lang='pi' translate='no'>upādinna</i>). One of the key functions of the aggregates is to categorize theories of the self. From the discourses, non-Buddhists seem to be familiar with this, yet we cannot identify the aggregates in any pre-Buddhist texts. Regardless of whether the set of categories was pre-Buddhist, the Buddha treated them in his own distinctive way, emphasizing that nothing in the aggregates was a permanent self or soul. In this collection we find a large number of striking and lively narratives, showing how the aggregates could be a solace at the time of death, a guide to the knotty theoretical debates on identity, or a framework for insight meditation. Many of the short abbreviated texts are built from the same templates employed in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields”.","nav":{"prev":"sn21","next":"sn23"}},"sn22.107":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"SN 22.107","translated_title":"Ascetics (1st)","original_title":"Samaṇasutta","author_uid":"sujato","blurb":"Only a true ascetic fully understands the five aggregates.","nav":{"prev":"sn22.106","next":"sn22.108"},"chunk":1},"sn31.19":{"type":"alias","target_uid":"sn31.13-22"},"sn32.19":{"type":"alias","target_uid":"sn32.13-52"},"sn34.49":{"type":"alias","target_uid":"sn34.46-49"},"sn23.13":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"SN 23.13","translated_title":"Impermanence","original_title":"Aniccasutta","author_uid":"sujato","blurb":"Rādha asks the Buddha about impermanence, and the Buddha explains in terms of the five aggregates.","nav":{"prev":"sn23.12","next":"sn23.14"},"chunk":22},"sn22.125":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"SN 22.125","translated_title":"With Kappa (2nd)","original_title":"Dutiyakappasutta","author_uid":"sujato","blurb":"Venerable Kappa asks the Buddha how to see so as to let go of conceit and be freed.

The six sense fields complement the five aggregates as the summary of the noble truth of suffering. Where the aggregates focus on the functional structure of experience as basis for views of self, the emphasis here is on how sense experience stimulates desire. Despite this difference in orientation, the two collections share much in common, and often the exact same template is applied in both cases. The six sense fields are the means through which the world is known, and so each of them has an “inner” and an “outer” aspect—the “eye” and “sights”, etc. Though common, it’s best to avoid thinking of the external sense field as the “object”, since in the suttas they are depicted in relation to the observing mind, and not as independently existing entities. This is straightforward until we come to the last sense, the “mind” and “thoughts” or “mental phenomena”. Just to clear up a possible confusion, this “sixth sense” is simply the mental faculty, and has nothing to do with psychic powers. The outer aspect is <i lang='pi' translate='no'>dhammā</i>, a term so ambiguous its translation is always difficult. Here it refers to anything that may be known directly by the mind, distinct from the five senses. The most technically correct translation is probably “mental phenomena”, but “thought’ may be used as a more colloquial rendering, so long as it includes ideas, imagination, and so on, not just verbalized cognition.","nav":{"prev":"sn34","next":"sn36"}},"sn35-aniccavagga":{"type":"branch","translated_title":"The Chapter on  Impermanence","original_title":"Aniccavagga","nav":{"prev":"sn22-ditthivagga","next":"sn35-yamakavagga"}},"sn21.12":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"SN 21.12","translated_title":"Companions","original_title":"Sahāyakasutta","author_uid":"sujato","blurb":"The Buddha praises two friends who are students of Venerable Mahākappina","nav":{"prev":"sn21.11","next":"sn22.1"}},"sn35.1":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"SN 35.1","translated_title":"The Interior as Impermanent","original_title":"Ajjhattāniccasutta","author_uid":"sujato","blurb":"The six interior sense fields are impermanent, suffering, and not-self.

The word “linked” refers to the fact that the texts are collected and organized by topic. In most cases the organizing principle is a particular theme of Dhamma, for example, the five aggregates, dependent origination, the noble eightfold path, mindfulness meditation, or the four noble truths. This collection contains the most extensive range of texts on these core themes. In other cases chapters are organized according to the person or kind of person who speaks. This collection has a full parallel in the Saṁyuktāgama (SA) of the Sarvāstivāda school in Chinese translation. In addition, there are two partial collections in Chinese (SA-2 and SA-3) as well as a number of miscellaneous or fragmentary texts in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. Much of the organizational structure of SN is shared with SA, suggesting that this structure preceded the split between these two collections.","nav":{"prev":"mn","next":"an"}}},"super_book_id":"sn","super_book_title":"Linked Discourses Collection"}
