The list of topics is closely related to the Saṁyutta Nikāya—aggregates, senses, dependent origination, etc. Most of the chapters have a threefold structure. (1) Analysis according to the suttas: this quotes a key passage from the suttas on the relvant topic and offers a modest analysis. (2) Analysis according to the Abhidhamma: applies the sets of synonyms and terms as developed in the Dhammasaṅgaṇī. (3) Catechism: tests the students knowledge with systematic questioning. A few sections, such as Vb 18 Dhammahadaya, do not fit this system. They may have originated as independent treatises.","nav":{"prev":"ds","next":"dt"}},"vb1":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 1","translated_title":"Analysis of the Aggregates","original_title":"Khandhavibhaṅga","nav":{"next":"vb2"},"chunk":0},"vb13":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 13","translated_title":"Analysis of the Illimitables","original_title":"Appamaññāvibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb12","next":"vb14"},"chunk":4},"vb8":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 8","translated_title":"Analysis of Right Striving","original_title":"Sammappadhānavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb7","next":"vb9"},"chunk":16},"vb12":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 12","translated_title":"Analysis of Jhāna","original_title":"Jhānavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb11","next":"vb13"},"chunk":3},"vb17":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 17","translated_title":"Analysis of Small Items","original_title":"Khuddakavatthuvibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb16","next":"vb18"},"chunk":8},"vb2":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 2","translated_title":"Analysis of the Bases","original_title":"Āyatanavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb1","next":"vb3"},"chunk":10},"vb4":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 4","translated_title":"Analysis of the Truths","original_title":"Saccavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb3","next":"vb5"},"chunk":12},"vb6":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 6","translated_title":"The Analysis of Conditional Origination","original_title":"Paṭiccasamuppādavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb5","next":"vb7"},"chunk":14},"vb5":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 5","translated_title":"Analysis of the Controlling Faculties","original_title":"Indriyavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb4","next":"vb6"},"chunk":13},"vb9":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 9","translated_title":"Analysis of the Bases of Accomplishment","original_title":"Iddhipādavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb8","next":"vb10"},"chunk":17},"vb10":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 10","translated_title":"Analysis of the Enlightenment Factors","original_title":"Bojjhaṅgavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb9","next":"vb11"},"chunk":1},"vb16":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 16","translated_title":"Analysis of Knowledge","original_title":"Ñāṇavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb15","next":"vb17"},"chunk":7},"vb18":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 18","translated_title":"Analysis of the Heart of the Teaching","original_title":"Dhammahadayavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb17"},"chunk":9},"vb14":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 14","translated_title":"Analysis of the Precepts","original_title":"Sikkhāpadavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb13","next":"vb15"},"chunk":5},"vb11":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 11","translated_title":"Analysis of the Path Constituents","original_title":"Maggaṅgavibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb10","next":"vb12"},"chunk":2},"vb15":{"type":"leaf","acronym":"Vb 15","translated_title":"Analysis of Analytic Insight","original_title":"Paṭisambhidāvibhaṅga","nav":{"prev":"vb14","next":"vb16"},"chunk":6},"ds":{"type":"branch","acronym":"Ds","translated_title":"Compendium of Phenomena ","original_title":"Dhammasaṅgaṇī","blurb":"The Dhammasaṅgaṇī (Compendium of Phenomena) is built on the idea of a <i lang='pi' translate='no'>mātikā</i>, a lists of contents or matrix.
