The Vibhaṅga is divided into eight chapters, each dealing with a separate class of rules, grouped according to the offense incurred in breaking them, with the exception of the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>aniyatas</i> (“the undetermined”) and the <i lang='pi' translate='no'>adhikaraṇasamathadhamma</i> (“the principles for resolving legal issues”), which are principles to be applied rather than rules in the strict sense. Each rule together with its explanatory material forms an independent unit, a sub-chapter. These units begin with one or more origin stories, which tell the circumstances that led the Buddha to lay down a particular rule. The rule is then stated, followed by a word commentary that analyzes every significant word contained in the rule. After the word commentary follows a permutation series in which a variety of different scenarios are evaluated and offenses assigned as appropriate. At the end comes a non-offense clause, stating important exceptions to the rule, sometimes followed by individual case studies, in which the Buddha decides the offense incurred in ambiguous cases."},"pli-tv-kd":{"type":"branch","acronym":"Kd","translated_title":"The Chapters ","original_title":"Khandhaka","blurb":"The Khandhakas (“the Chapters”) comprise the rules and regulations of both Sanghas that fall outside of the Monastic Code, the Pātimokkha. There are 22 individual Khandhakas, most of which discuss a more or less unified topic. The Khandhakas include a variety of material, such as assorted biographical material of a number of eminent disciples and some notorious ones. They also incorporate a few Jātakas and other tales, as well as the stories of the first communal recitation after the Buddha’s passing away and the famous Vesālī affair, sometimes known as “the second council”. The whole collection is structured around the life of the Buddha after his awakening."}}}
